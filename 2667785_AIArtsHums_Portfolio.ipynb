    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "<p>The Bible has influenced language, imagery, and society, becoming what Hull describes as the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4122404\">'norm' </a>for countless generations in western society. Its narratives also hold the potential to empower individuals; this is particularly relevant for disabled people whom biblical stories have the potential to offer a source of liberation given the roles and contributions of disabled figures. Despite the few references to characters with disabilities in the New Testament, figures like Paul—<a href=\"https://boletindeliteratuoral.com/index.php/bdlo/article/view/67\">who, may have lived with a visual impairment following his conversion</a>—embody the impact that disabled individuals had on both society and history. Yet, accessing these narratives presents barriers. Historically, the majority of people in western nations were illiterate and biblical knowledge was <a href=\"https://reflections.yale.edu/article/between-babel-and-beatitude/holy-bible-30-scripture-digital-age\">passed through church paintings, stained glass, and oral tradition</a>; perhaps this is more accessible than modern Christianity following the scripture. As we navigate the modern world, challenges persist in terms of accessibility and barriers affecting disabled people’s ability in accessing the Bible's pages independently. </p>"

    "<h2>Context</h2>\n",
    "<p>AI art and printing share a closer relationship than we might initially think. The advent of printmaking and the printing press was a pivotal milestone in the history of art and technology, revolutionizing how we produce, consume, and interpret art. Similarly, AI has initiated another evolutionary leap that impacted these processes and prompts us to further our understanding of creativity. The intent behind this project is to focus on the intersection of accessibility, generative AI, and religion. The main question here is how religious objects can best be approached to encourage a dialogue among a wider audience, using generative AI. Paine criticizes the idea that encountering religious objects is limited to a mental and disembodied experience and suggests that religious objects have more to offer than appreciation for their aesthetic: \"It’s not until one has seen religious objects in use – either in an actual way or in some virtual way – that they truly come alive, that one can get a glimpse, if you like, into the souls of these objects\". </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Building upon this, this project explores generative AI to further explore the Raised Type New Testament, originally in Greek and formally translated and printed by the New York American Bible Society. This project requires access to the University of Glasgow's Special Collections for digitisation. This is available for public access but prior booking is necessary at the <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/archivespecialcollections/\">University of Glasgow Archives & Special Collections</a>. Many thanks goes to Robert McClean for guiding this project and showcasing the objects virtually and in person.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The essence of religious artifacts, including the Raised Type New Testament, can be connected with their historical context. This connection is not only about the physicality of these objects but also their role in the practice of faith, as highlighted by Paine's perspective. Paine argues that religion transcends a system of ideas, emphasizing it as a practice rooted in tangible objects. In this light, the Raised Type Bible embodies more than just a text; it represents the history of a practice of engaging with the sacred, making it a critical tool for inclusivity and accessibility in religion.</p>\n",

    "<p>The overall objective of this project is to engage with the Raised Type New Testament beyond its religious context by presenting it as a cultural artifact. It aims to explore to situate the object within its cultural and historical context. By doing so, it aims appeals to a broader audience that is interested not only in theology but also hidden histories of disablity and accessible practices. The Raised Type New Testament ought to be recognised not just as a religious scripture but as a cultural object that reflects early accounts of accessible practices. \n",

    "<h3>Human-AI Collaboration</h3> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This project embraces AI as a collaborator, acknowledging that while AI does not possess creative intention in the human sense, its outputs can reshape the human artist's intent in a meaningful way. AI can potentially shift creative expression—challenging us to reconsider the relationship between the medium and the creative ideas. This includes how we value art and whether it is the labour behind or other aspects, think of oil paintings! With using existing generative AI models, there is no intensive manual effort that is traditionally associated with artmaking. This might be present in projects that program their AI model and digitise their training data, from the start to the finish, but perhaps is not in the usual use of models like Dall-e. This prompts us to question how we value art when the labour behind it becomes less visible and more intellectual. You might also want to consider how immersion in the creative process changes, as AI allows for rapid experimentation of concepts that might otherwise would require hours of labour to envision. In this, we find a new form of value: the capacity to explore more ideas and engage in deeper reflection. </p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In this project, the initiation of ideas was human, and the production of art and output was AI. I decided on the prompts and ideas, then had the AI generate them. I digitised the Raised Type New Testament and had that converted into machine-readable text. Then, based on the page I randomly selected to show how this process can be conducted I decided to let AI narrate it, convert the narration into audio, generate images based on the narration, decide on the description of the music to match the narration, and based on that, I combined the different multimedia elements and used subtitles. Following these, I made ai write a description of the object and the video that it generated to see how it could be placed in GLAMs. I then proofread it. You might think of this collaboration as the generative ai models i used were a talented mutlimedia artist in all domains, and I am the project manager giving feedback on what works and what doesn’t for our clients. </p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You might think, all of these can be done manually—so what is the point? Well, in this project, I considered that with little funding for both humanities and disability studies, this project had low funding environments in GLAMs. With <a href=\"https://openglam.pubpub.org/pub/barriers-to-open-access/release/1\">reduced funding</a>, GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) are reluctant to give up any income, no matter how minimal. </p> ></p> \r\n",

    "<h3>Technologies Used</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Digitisation & Optical Character Recognition</li>\n",
    "<p>The process began with digitizing the text through high-resolution scanning using an iPhone 14 camera, which provided the necessary image quality. Following this, preprocessing steps were undertaken to optimize the image; notably, the file size was reduced using Microsoft Paint to facilitate easier handling. To convert the captured image into machine-readable text, the <a href=\"https://www.imagetotext.info/\">imagetotext</a> platform was utilized, which offers its services free of charge and without requiring login information. At the core of this conversion process lies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. OCR employs pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, to meticulously identify and classify each character captured within the document. This intricate process includes comparing the elements of the scanned image against a database of known characters and interpreting the text's structure. The ultimate goal is to transform the information into a digital format that accurately mirrors the original document, thus enabling functionalities like text search and editing, all while retaining the integrity of the original text.</p>\n",
    "<li>Narration & Commentary</li>\n",
    "<p>For narration purposes, <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-17Xx6gBcE-biblegpt?utm_source=gptshunter.com\">\"BibleGPT\"</a> was employed, which is a custom library available at ChatGPT. This variant is developed through a process called fine-tuning, which involves training the original model with additional datasets, integrating bespoke instructions, and a range of capabilities tailored to specific use. The development of BibleGPT involved enhancing the base model's capabilities by introducing targeted data sets, thereby expanding its comprehension and response capabilities in context-specific domains, aka the bible. Access to the standard ChatGPT platform is available at no cost and requires users to register for an account. However, BibleGPT necessitates access to the GPT-4, which needs subscription behind a paywall. BibleGPT was developed by Daniel Abraham.</p>\n",
    "<li>Image Generation</li>\n",
    "<p>The script-to-image generator is an advanced tool designed to convert textual scripts into visual images, effectively <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-u6ooEbi8z-script-to-video-generator\">“automating the content creation process”</a>. Developed as a specialized library within the ChatGPT by OpenAI, it uses the Dall-e model to interpret and visualize scripts. This innovative tool was crafted by <a href=\"https://www.charlyaisolutions.com/\">Charly AI Solutions</a>, marking a significant stride in the field of automated digital content production. In a manner akin to BibleGPT, the Script-to-Image library undergoes a rigorous fine-tuning process. This involves the integration of extensive additional datasets into the DALL·E model, particularly a diverse collection of images. Such an approach enhances the model's ability to produce highly customised and contextually relevant images across a wide spectrum of user inputs, thereby broadening its application and utility in digital content generation. The Script-to-Image custom library is meant to compliment Sora once it is released, however, during the time this project is conducted it is only able to release images. </p>\n",

    "<li>Audio Narration</li>\n",
    "<p><a href=\"https://www.narakeet.com/\">Narakeet</a> is an online platform that utilizes text-to-speech (TTS) technology to transform written text into spoken voice, making it a powerful tool for creating and editing video content. The TTS engine within Narakeet converts text to audio. This technology, originally developed to aid in reading back documents on computers, has evolved to produce voices that sound natural and can accurately recognize words, phrases, and sentences. Narakeet offers flexibility in content presentation and sharing, enhancing projects with high-quality audio narration tailored with multiple voices. Most features are free to use, and it does not require any log in.</p>\n",
    "<li>Music</li>\n",
    "<p><a href=\"https://soundrawhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\">SOUNDRAW</a> utilizes a unique AI generation process for its music creation. Users begin by setting parameters such as mood, genre, and instruments through the \"Create Music\" tab, which guides the AI in generating a personalized song list. This list comprises original samples and sounds curated by our in-house team of music producers. Once a song is selected from the list, users can fine-tune it using the editor. If unsatisfied with the initial list, users have the option to regenerate it by adjusting the tags or utilize the advanced Pro Mode for further customization. In this project, SOUNDRAW was used as an external application with Canva. It is free for use, but requires log in. </p>\n",
    "<li>Video Editing & Final Touches</li>\n",
    "<p>For combining the elements <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a> was used. Users can access Canva for free by visiting their website and logging into their account. With Canva, you can combine various elements such as images, text, graphics, and animations to craft visually appealing and engaging multimedia content. Canva also has built in generative AI applications, including the aforementioned SOUNDRAW, that users can use to streamline the editing process.</p>\n",
    "<li>Braille Conversion</li>\n",
    "<p>For converting the text into braille, <a href=\"https://abcbraille.com/braille\">abcbraille</a> was used. Braille transcription software functions by translating text characters, words, punctuation, and document formatting into equivalent braille characters. The resulting braille file can then be output to either a refreshable braille display or a braille embosser, which prints a tactile copy on paper for reading by touch. For this project, in order to be inclusive, UEB Braille Grade 1 was used as Contracted (Grade 2) braille is used by experienced braille users, making sure all braille users can understand in case this project was to be printed.\r\n",

    "<p>Reflection Point: Is this what is supposed to takeover our jobs? Haha :) The output from the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process applied to the \"Raised Type Bible\" illustrates both the strengths and the challenges of using OCR on historical documents. It did manage to transform the printed text into a digital format, maintaining the core content and structure. However, it also introduces several errors, such as misspellings, unusual character substitutions, and formatting inconsistencies, including concatenated words and misplaced punctuation. These issues highlight the necessity for post-processing to refine the text and enhance its readability. However, it is still impressive given that it is the Raised Type and that I did not adjust any contrast! OCR offers significant benefits by converting non-searchable images into searchable text, greatly improving accessibility for researchers, students, and the general public. This just comes to show how we are better in collaboration cause now I just need to fix up the text!\r\n",

    "<p>In a world where every person is valued not by their abilities but by their inherent worth as beings created in the image of God, there unfolds a story—a story that reimagines the birth and early life of Jesus, highlighting the significance of inclusion, empathy, and understanding, especially from the perspective of those with disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Chapter 1: The Announcement of Emmanuel </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a modest home in Nazareth, where daily life is a testament to resilience and faith, Mary and Joseph prepare for their future together. Joseph, perhaps facing his own challenges in a society where physical and mental differences are often misunderstood, is visited by an angel in a dream. This celestial messenger brings news that transcends human understanding: Mary will bear a child, not through ordinary means, but by the Holy Spirit. This child, Jesus, will be called Emmanuel, \"God with us,\" symbolizing God's presence in a world filled with both joy and suffering, capability and limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joseph, upon waking, faces a decision. In a society where differences are often seen as burdens, accepting this child and his extraordinary origin requires a faith that sees beyond the physical, recognizing the divine purpose in every life. Moved by this vision, Joseph embraces his role, not just as a caregiver but as a father to a child who represents hope for all, including those often marginalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4> Chapter 2: A Star in the East </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, wise men from distant lands, scholars who have faced their own societal barriers due to their unconventional beliefs and practices, observe a new star. This celestial phenomenon leads them on a journey, not just across deserts and mountains, but toward a deeper understanding of worth and dignity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arriving in Jerusalem, they seek the newborn king, their quest highlighting the contrast between societal expectations and God’s kingdom, where the last shall be first, and the first, last. Their journey to Bethlehem, guided by the star, becomes a metaphor for the journey of every person who has faced exclusion and longing for acceptance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple dwelling in Bethlehem, they find Jesus with Mary. Their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh are symbolic, not just of kingship and divinity, but of a life that will include suffering and sacrifice—experiences familiar to those living with disabilities. Their worship is a profound recognition of Jesus' mission to embrace the overlooked and to dignify those society deems undignified.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>The Flight to Egypt </h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the story continues, Joseph is warned in a dream of Herod’s plans. The holy family’s flight to Egypt reflects the experiences of many who, because of their disabilities, find themselves fleeing from misunderstanding, prejudice, and violence. In Egypt, a land foreign and unfamiliar, Jesus grows up with stories of flight and refuge, instilling in him a deep empathy for the marginalized and oppressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This retelling of Jesus' early days through the lens of disability does not diminish the divine but highlights it. It speaks to a God who chooses the unexpected path, who values the heart over outward ability, and who is present in vulnerability and strength alike. It is a story that reminds us that in God’s kingdom, every person—regardless of physical or mental capability—is precious, valued, and called to a purpose that transcends earthly limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reimagined narrative, the focus on disabilities illuminates the Christian belief in a God who embraces all aspects of human experience, offering hope, presence, and a promise of redemption for every person, especially those whom society might overlook or underestimate.</p>"

    "<p>Reflection Point: The model's ability to adapt traditional narratives to modern themes of inclusivity, particularly from the perspective of individuals with disabilities is not too bad! In fact, this is where it can connect patterns and where humans can occasionally miss. Now in terms of reflecting on the outcome, it might be considered oversimplifying complex biblical and theological themes to fit contemporary social issues. In fact, when I told GPT-4 to reflect on this, it said it can “lead to interpretations that might feel forced or overly tailored to modern agendas, potentially alienating those who value a more traditional interpretation of biblical texts. Moreover, while the model successfully highlights societal barriers and promotes an inclusive perspective, it could enhance its approach by integrating more diverse viewpoints and deeper theological analysis to avoid the risk of projecting modern values onto historical contexts inappropriately. This would enrich the narrative with a more balanced view that respects historical authenticity while still engaging with modern concerns”. However, knowing that the traditional bible is perceived as alienating by a vast number of people, the model has not considered that the bible has been examined over the years through multiple lenses. It does consider the need for contextualising the facts, which is a very valid point. In terms of narrative technique, the retelling could benefit from a seamless integration of themes. At times, the emphasis on disability and societal barriers felt like a final afterthought. Balancing these elements more effectively would make the retelling robust, providing a richer understanding of the narratives that respects both their origins and their contemporary applications. </p>"

    "<h2>Discussion & Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "<p>The use of generative AI in communicating the Raised Type New Testament into accessible formats holds potential but also presents unique challenges. Effectiveness can be assessed through user engagement and feedback from many backgrounds, including museum curators, theologists, the disabled community, and content creators ensuring that these new formats truly meet their needs. While AI can facilitate the creation of accessible religious content, it also raises concerns about the accuracy and sensitivity of these translations. There is a risk of oversimplification or misinterpretation when complex theological concepts are automatically translated into different formats. Integrating technology with traditional religious practices offers opportunities to reach a broader audience and enrich their spiritual experiences, but it also necessitates ongoing dialogue between technologists, theologians, and the community to ensure that the essence of the scripture is preserved and conveyed accurately. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Reinterpreting religious texts can pose social, ethical, and theological questions. Socially, the initiative could promote greater inclusion within religious communities, offering disabled individuals more direct and meaningful engagement with these texts. However, as the project promised to show the object beyond religion, socially it shows how disabled people were not discussed in terms of Christianity history. Ethically, the project navigates the delicate balance of modifying sacred texts to be more inclusive while respecting their original message Theologically, this approach could prompt a re-evaluation of traditional interpretations of scriptures, especially concerning views on disability. Maintaining the integrity of the original texts while ensuring they are accessible and relevant to all, including people with disabilities, requires careful consideration of the language and methods used in such adaptations.  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Raised Type New Testament is an excellent demonstration of how religion, disability, and technology have intersected before. This project mirrors that, to intersect them once again, instead of printing it uses generative AI. This project not only have broadened accessibility of communicating the object, but also challenges traditional models of religious engagement. </p>"

    "<h2>Final Reflection</h2>\n",
    "<p>Reflecting on creating this project, it has opened a new way to look at biblical stories. We've reconsidered traditional narratives with a theme of disability, inspired by the context of the Raised Type New Testament. In each storyboard, I aimed to show not just scenes from the Bible but also to bring out disability representation. This might have come across very superficial and perhaps socially accurate, but it considers the recurrent question in history—where are all the disabled people? This project wasn't just about digital arts or storytelling; it was about digging deeper into how we see and represent people in the stories we tell. By looking at these old stories through a new lens, this portfolio invites everyone to think differently about who is remembered and who is overlooked. It's a call to recognize that people of all abilities have always been part of our history and our lives; especially in social spaces like museums. </p>\n",
    "<p>This project required much more thinking in terms of ideas rather than the implementation. In my personal judgement and my peer support groups', this project met the objectives. Credit needs to be given when its due: many thanks to my peer support group for splitting the cost together for a GPT-4 account. An extra thanks goes for your support, continous feedback, and more importantly keeping my project aligned with my chosen objects.</p>"

Determining copyright ownership becomes intricate when considering the influence of training data, the extent of human involvement in the generation process, and the evolving legal interpretations surrounding AI-generated content. In this case of this project, I used Dall-e, owned by OpenAI that are not transparent of their training data. There is a pressing need for robust legal and ethical frameworks to clarify ownership, attribution, licensing, and fair use practices, ensuring that the rights of creators and users are appropriately balanced in the digital age.
