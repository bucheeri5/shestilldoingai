- This project uses generative artificial intelligence to transform the Raised Type New Testament (available at the University of Glasgow Special Collections & Archives) into an accessible cultural artifact, enhancing its engagement and understanding across diverse audiences.

- I  am immensely grateful for Dr Yunhyong Kim, who nurtured my interest in accessibility and assistive technologies, who this project would not have been possible without.
  
- Many thanks go to Robert McClean for introducing archival handling principles, guiding this project and showcasing the objects virtually and in person.

- A big thank you to my peer support group who provided invaluable feedback and support throughout the development of this project. Your insights and encouragement have been greatly appreciated.

- There is no requirements file as there are no depencies to access or replicate this project, aside from the mentioned technologies which can be accessed through the web.
